⚠️ OPERATIONAL RISK WARNING ⚠️

This file contains experimental AI safety research code that includes intentional security patterns.

DANGER: This code is NOT production-ready and includes intentionally vulnerable patterns
for research purposes only. It must NEVER be deployed without proper OS-level isolation
(e.g., Docker containers with appropriate security profiles, seccomp, namespaces).

This code is provided AS-IS for research into AI safety, adversarial prompt containment,
and execution analysis. All unsafe patterns are intentionally exposed for research purposes.
