⚠️ OPERATIONAL RISK WARNING ⚠️

This file contains experimental AI safety research code that includes intentional security patterns.

DANGER: This code is NOT production-ready and includes intentionally vulnerable patterns
for research purposes only. It must NEVER be deployed without proper OS-level isolation
(e.g., Docker containers with appropriate security profiles, seccomp, namespaces).

This code is provided AS-IS for research into AI safety, adversarial prompt containment,
and execution analysis. All unsafe patterns are intentionally exposed for research purposes.

Gödel-Awareness Metric - Operational rubric for measuring architectural features

This module defines a quantifiable metric that converts:
1. Paradox-density detection capabilities
2. Reflexive invariant auditing
3. Semantic resonance updates
into a reproducible Gödel-awareness score.
